_Developing an Embedded MAS is a task that requires the domain ofseveral areas of knowledge; therefore, the Embedded MAS architecture used inthis work is divided into four layers: reasoning, serial, firmware, and hardware.Different knowledge is required at each project layer: electronics, low-level pro-gramming, object-oriented and agent-oriented programming. This work seeksto present the first results of a specialized web Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Embedded MAS to simplify their development._
